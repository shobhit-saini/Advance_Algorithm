1. You are given a text file, named “students.txt” that contains students’ records. Each line
contains information of a single student in the form of <Student Name, Roll No,
Department>.
a. Read the records from the file into an array of structures.
b. Four Options will turn up: (1) Merge Sort, (2) Quick Sort, (3) Binary Search,
and (4) Quit. In the following we describe what your C/C++ program will do on
selecting the options.
c. (1) Merge Sort: Sorts the records based on Student Name. If more than one
students has the same name, then sort them on their roll no.
(2) Quick Sort: Sorts the records based on Student Name. If more than one students
has the same name, then sort them on their roll no.
(3) Binary Search: Given a student name, the function will return all the student
records <Student Name, Roll No, Department> having the student name.
(4) Quit: Exit the program.
