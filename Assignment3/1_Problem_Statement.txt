1. Round-Robin Elimination Problem: There are n people standing in a circle. In the first step,
the counting starts at person 1 and proceeds around the circle, and the k-th person is eliminated.
Next, the counting starts from the person next to the eliminated one, then k-1 people are
skipped and the k-th person is eliminated. The elimination proceeds around the circle until the
last person remains, who is the winner. Given n people and a number k, write a C program that
outputs the winner.
Example 1: If n = 5 and k = 2, then the winner is person 3.
First, the person at position 2 is eliminated, then person at position 4 is eliminated, then person
at position 1 is eliminated. Finally, the person at position 5 is eliminated. So the person at
position 3 wins.
Example 2: If n = 7 and k = 3, then the winner is person 4.
First, the person at position 3 is eliminated, then person at position 6 is eliminated, then person
at position 2 is eliminated, then person at position 2 is eliminated, then person at position 7 is
eliminated. Finally, the person at position 1 is eliminated. So the person at position 4 wins.
